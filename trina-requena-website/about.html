          <h2>I never felt right where I was.</h2>
          <p>
            I kept looking for the place where I belonged. In my twenties, I travelled the world and worked as international cabin crew. I was constantly in the air and had lost the ground beneath my feet. I was surrounded by people but felt lonely. I kept moving from place to place without any real direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>One night,</strong> as we were flying back from Greece, I sat alone in the quiet cabin and looked out into a sky full of stars. In that stillness, something inside me became clear.

        <h3>The Turning Point</h3>
        <p>
          I realised that I needed to dedicate my life to something bigger, something that truly mattered. Not on the outside but on the inside, on the level of the heart. That was what I had been longing for so deeply myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          That night, I decided to take responsibility for my life. I left my job and began training as a yoga teacher.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Journey Inward</h3>
        <p>
          It was the beginning of a long journey inward. Over the last three decades, I discovered that aligning the posture not only influences the body, it shapes the way we live.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When we create stability in the body, we find freedom in the mind and openness in the heart.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This understanding, together with the beauty of life and the birth of my two children, sparked my curiosity to explore different modalities that support the body, mind, and heart — and to help people transform on every level.
        </p>
        
        <h3>My Vision</h3>
        <p>
          Many people today feel disconnected and out of alignment with themselves, leading to states of anxiety and unfulfillment. When we create alignment on all levels — body, mind, and heart — we can build a strong foundation from which ease, joy, and clarity can naturally arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vision is to support a global shift, one person at a time, guiding us to become heart-led leaders of our own lives.
